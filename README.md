Game Ghosts Attack.
In Ghosts Attack, the player controls a wizard
that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The
player can move the wizard right and left using the
arrow keys and shoot magic ball using the spacebar.
When the game begins, a crowd of ghosts fills the sky
and moves across and down the screen. The player
shoots and destroys the ghosts. If the player shoots
all the ghosts, a new crowd appears that moves faster
than the previous crowd. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s
wizard or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player
loses a heart. If the player loses three hearts, the game
ends.
